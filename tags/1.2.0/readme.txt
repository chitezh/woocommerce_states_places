Wordpress plugin that shows dropdowns for State and City Select for woocomerce

== Description ==

This WooCommerce plugin transforms the text input for states, the city or town. With this plugin you can provide a list of states and cities to be shown as a select dropdown.

This will be shown in checkout pages, edit addresses pages, shipping calculator, etc.

= Supported Countries =

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

WordPress 4.0  or greater
Woocommerce 2.2 or greater
PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click `Add New`.

Search for `States, Cities, and Places for Woocommerce`, install and activate

= Manual installation =

[See wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
